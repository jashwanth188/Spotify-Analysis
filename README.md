# Spotify Analysis Project
 This project performs an analysis of Spotify music data using a Jupyter Notebook. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and various visualizations to gain insights into music trends.
 
 ## Project Overview
 The project is designed to:- Analyze Spotify dataset for trends and patterns.- Visualize key metrics like popularity, song features, and genre distribution.- Use Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
 
 ## Files in the Repository- `SpotifyAnalysis.ipynb`: 
 Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualizations.- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the notebook.- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for the analysis (you should provide a link to the dataset if too large to upload).
 ## Installation
 To run this project locally, follow these steps:
 1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jashwanth188/Spotify-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spotify-analysis
   ```
 3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
 4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SpotifyAnalysis.ipynb

   ```
 
 ## Usage
 Explore the dataset, run the cells, and visualize the data in the Jupyter notebook.
